When we found the property in 2010, it was abandoned. But, we fell in love with it, and the beginning of Chetwyn Farm shortly followed. \n\n \n\nOn the first day of visiting the property, we found some lemon and grapefruit trees dotting the upper road. This piqued our interest, since we had experimented with growing different fruit trees in the small backyard of our previous home. When we found an avocado tree among the citrus, our avocado adventures began.\n\n \n\nNow we have added over 450 avocado trees to our farm—in addition to many other fruits trees and vegetables and a herd of goats. There have been lots of challenges but even more blessings, and we have enjoyed every minute of living here",

    "Additional Information":"Tucked in the hills of Fremont, California is an agricultural hidden gem. As you probably know, our state is the country’s largest producer of avocados, but what you might not guess is that one of those producers is actually right here in our own backyard. While the majority of avocado farming takes place in Southern California in areas like Ventura and San Diego, doctors Priti and Ramavtar Singh had the idea to use their 12 residential acres in Fremont and try planting avocado trees. \n",

    "Farmer Bios":"Inspired by their joint experience in the medical field, and Ram’s interest in farming, they wanted to grow a crop that was both unique and nutritious. Priti worked for more than 30 years as an ER doctor and an allergist, and her conviction that locally-grown produce can positively impact our health and quality of life, is a driving factor in their choice to invest in growing avocados. After being discouraged by other farmers, warning that avocados would not survive in the Northern California climate, Ram was even more determined to bring their ideas to fruition. \n\nOver a decade later, Singh Farm is growing more than 2,000 avocado trees! And it is truly a labor of love. Ram Singh likes to do everything himself, from tending to the plants to harvesting the fruit and even selling at the farmers’ market. Since first joining PCFMA farmers’ markets years ago, Singh Farm has developed a loyal following of customers in their local Irvington Farmers’ Market, and the friendly faces are what keeps their family inspired to continue providing their delicious superfoods to the community. “About 70-80% of our buyers are the same buyers, so we know them by name, they wave and say ‘How are you,’ and ‘Thank you,” Ram said, adding that the 4-5 hours he spends selling at the farmers’ market each week are his favorite part of the week. His passion for his community and connecting with his neighbors extends even beyond his own booth at the market. During his off-season, between the months of October to April, you can still find Ram at the farmer’s market, helping his fellow farmers behind their booths. ",

Today, Brentwood is famous for its sweet corn production, particularly a variety called Brentwood Diamonds, which G&S Farms was the first to grow in the 1990’s.",

Bill wanted to practice farming, something never before possible for Jews in Europe.\n\nFleeing the increasing threat of the Nazis, Bill and his mother went first to Palestine in 1936. Later, in 1937, visiting land owned by family members near San Luis Obispo, he fell in love with the California landscape and chose to settle there.\n\nAfter studying agriculture at the University of California in Berkeley and Davis, Bill purchased a small dairy on Tomales Bay in 1941. The dairy was on the outskirts of the hamlet of Marshall, situated on the eastern shore of Tomales Bay in western Marin County. He started farming with 23 Jersey cows, which he named after family and friends.\n\nStraus was an innovative dairyman, often the first in the region to adopt new and environmentally-sound agricultural practices. He co-founded the Tomales Bay Association, which served as a coalition of the area’s environmentalists and farmers, just one of many steps for land conservation.",

In times past, wine grapes grew as part of a rich regional culinary tradition. The food of the region informed and possibly drove the wine industry, creating natural pairings handed down through generations. RSVnapa’s vineyards are a haven for honey bees, birds of prey, vibrant flowers, bountiful fruit orchards and lush vegetable gardens. The bounty from each season complements our wine, adds dimension to RSVnapa dinner menus, sparks creative ideas and lifts the senses.\n\nEvery vine for every wine was planted by RSVnapa with every vineyard certified* organic.                 https:\/\/www.robertsinskey.com\/the-dirt\/vineyards\/",

    "Farmer Bios":"Winemaking, for us, is a natural extension of farming. We have both worked for many years in the sustainable agriculture and local food movement, and in 2003 we started Matthiasson Wines based on those values — purity, sense of place, respect, responsibility, deliciousness. Our wines are classical expressions of different grape varieties, some well-known like Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon, and some rare like Ribolla Gialla and Refosco. The deeply flavorful wines are refreshing, complement food, and are moderate in alcohol. Our small family winery is fiercely independent, no partners or investors, just the vision of Jill and Steve and a hard-working and passionate team. Our independence allows us to farm organically, with no compromises in the vineyard or the winery, creating the beautiful wines for which we are known.                                                                                                              https:\/\/www.matthiasson.com\/about\/",

After countless trips to the grocery store with Laddie, the two decided on pricing and bundling their bounty to be sold at a booth at the St Helena Farmer’s Market. They were a hit! This small vegetable garden would eventually propel Chris to build the vertically integrated agricultural business that Long Meadow Ranch is today and inspire him to pursue “excellence through responsible farming.”\n\nAfter studying geology and fire science at the University of Colorado, Chris returned to Napa Valley to drive the development of Long Meadow Ranch’s diversified farming activities and food and wine destination, Farmstead.\n\nChris lives in St Helena with his wife Tara and sons.                                                                                                                           https:\/\/www.longmeadowranch.com\/the-ranch\/who-we-are\/",

    "Farmer Bios":"Favia was born in 2003 as a collaboration between viticulturalist Annie Favia and winemaker Andy Erickson. The husband-and-wife team had held myriad responsibilities at some of Napa Valley’s most lauded wineries and vineyards before embarking on this still-unfolding narrative, with a simple mission: create soulful wines that express the true nature of the vineyards from which they come.\n\nFavia soon took root in Coombsville, Napa’s youngest AVA, with a family home and winery on a historic property, where the Favia-Ericksons restored the local ecology with native plants and took a holistic and historically sensitive approach to the planting of fruit orchards and a small, dry-farmed vineyard. Together with winemaker Jessica Tarpy, they collaborated on identifying other unique vineyard sites from the Vaca Mountains with soils, climate, and aspects ideal for growing exquisite wine grapes, developing strong relationships with select winegrowers to perfect their viticultural practices. In the winery, the team carefully coaxes grapes into wine with gentle handling and minimal intervention to allow the fruit to speak for itself—producing unparalleled wines, each with its own distinct character.\n\nIn early 2023, Favia became stewards of a beautiful 86-acre parcel in the heart of Oakville—one of the last undeveloped great estates in the Napa Valley. The new Favia property offers an opportunity to create something entirely new in the valley, while embodying their long-considered ethos: to be connected with the natural world, respect the ancient methods and places that they now steward, all while sharing the bounty that will come from this land with a wider community. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.faviawines.com\/history\/",

After graduating from Stanford with a degree in Economics, Bill joined the company in the 1970’s, leading our statewide field operations. In 2010, Bill became Managing Partner of the nation’s largest family garlic grower, and his stewardship of the company continues to this day. Under Bill’s watch, the company has successfully integrated itself into a continually globalized produce market, one of which could never have been imagined just a generation before. Faced with new challenges and complex realities, Bill has successfully navigated Christopher Ranch to become the preeminent garlic supplier in the United States.",

    "Farmer Bios":"After World War II, Sam and Jean Kawahara and their two children started growing plants on a 2-acre plot in San Lorenzo, CA where they pioneered the reputation of quality and excellence. In the early 80s, the narrative of Kawahara Nurseries expanded as sons David and John transplanted their vision to Morgan Hill, California. This pivotal move not only broadened the physical landscape but also diversified the nursery's offerings. Premium annuals, perennials, succulents, vegetables, and herbs became integral components of their ever-growing product selection. Under the guidance of David’s sons, Josh and Andrew, and John’s daughters, Sami and Megan, and son-in-law, Clinton, the nursery continues to evolve. Today, Kawahara Nurseries stands with multiple generations of family members and 300+ employees. ",

    "Farmer Bios":"The Dutton family’s farming heritage goes back to the 19th century. In 1881 Warren Dutton purchased the family’s first 200 acres in Santa Rosa. Joined by his brother Reed, the Dutton’s planted their property to the best varieties of French prunes, a hot commodity at the time.\n\nFor many years the family business prospered on prunes, with forays into pears and hops. Warren Dutton Jr., great-grandson of Reed Dutton, grew up picking prunes and hops on the farm. In 1964, young Warren and his new wife Gail bought their first 35 acres west of the town of Graton. Their original family home is now the current Dutton Ranch offices.\n\nIn the early days, most people knew the Duttons for their fruit stand in Santa Rosa, on Sebastopol Road just west of Stony Point Road. Unable to sell their fruit through normal distribution channels, Gail and young sons Joe and Steve peddled pears, prunes, apples, dried fruit and gift packs to passing motorists. They created a large mailing list, a novelty at the time, to keep their customers up to date on new developments. At the same time, Warren had the foresight to plant wine grapes, just prior to the downturn in the apple industry.\n\nIn 1985, the Duttons sold their Santa Rosa fruit stand and the surrounding property to developers. This ended one era for the family and opened a new one, as Gail and Warren put all their effort into expanding their West County holdings.",

    "Farmer Bios":"Muelrath Ranches, established in 1936 as a dairy in Bodega Bay, is a real working ranch. The Muelrath family added the Santa Rosa location in 1946, where Bob Muelrath still farms today growing pumpkins, gourds, winter squash and sunflowers. He also raises cattle and grows hay and silage. Bob and his wife Audrey strive to produce high quality, freshly picked products that are grown on site, sustainably farmed and are pesticide free. Products grown at Muelrath Ranches are available for both retail and wholesale purchase.\n\nThe patch is unique both for the quality of pumpkins and the size of the patch. Their unique pumpkin stems, colors, and varieties are a North Bay trademark. The picturesque pumpkin patch offers great family fun! Bob and Audrey invite those from far and wide to come climb a haystack, traverse the hay tunnel to a dungeon that contains silly and spooky things, follow the maze through tall cornstalks, or enjoy a hay ride.\n",

Toby founded a growth center, which sought to bridge humanistic psychology with Eastern and Western approaches to spiritual growth. Marti came on board and was soon facilitating popular groups working with art and dream journals. Julie showed up expecting to take up a few classes - and stayed!\n\nIn the 1970s, Brother Toby, Sister Marti, and Sister Julie each took monastic vows. \n\nWe decided to form a community and move to the country. In 1976 Starcross was established on a rundown homestead in northwestern Sonoma County. Being city folk, the first few years were challenging. We managed, however, to plant a garden, open a one room schoolhouse, write books, and begin supporting ourselves with a Christmas Wreath business, all while maintaining a monastic schedule and raising many young foster children.",

    "Farmer Bios":"Brooke Hazen, Founder & farmer: \nBrooke Hazen always dreamed of growing and selling farm to table foods under his own brand. A Southern California native, Brooke grew up loving the ocean and the natural world. His affinity for the land, healthy living, and natural foods eventually led him to move north in order to study Agriculture at Humboldt State and Prescott College. Brooke’s vision was to grow nutritious, organic foods and to sell them to his community in the San Francisco Bay Area. In the early days, he grew row crops and sold them at Farmers Markets. In 2001, Brooke’s dream to own land became a reality when he purchased 88 acres of pastureland in bucolic Sebastopol for olive, apples, and citrus and it became Gold Ridge Organic Farms. When he's not farming, Brooke has written a book on holistic health. \nGuillermo Rojas, Master Olive Miller: \nGuillermo is the Master Miller, and has been trained by Rapanelli, Pablo Cabanassas, and Pablo Voitzuk in the latest techniques for creating the highest quality olive oil. Hailing from Michoacan, Mexico he now calls Sonoma County home. He has worked for Gold Ridge Organic Farms since 2015. For the 15 years prior, he worked in the wine industry, tending grape vines. Guillermo is an accomplished mechanic who runs all aspects of the press and keeps our other machinery in optimal working order. In his free time, he enjoys tinkering with cars and spending time with his family. He also plays guitar, electric bass, and sings in a Mariachi band.\n\nNaomi Ansbergs, Marketing & Sales Manager: \nNaomi grew up in a small town south of Boston but found herself drawn to the vastness and beauty of the American West from an early age. Summers spent tending her mother's vegetable and herb gardens on their ¼ acre suburban farmette helped her draw the direct line from dirt to plate. After graduating from Smith College, she accepted a role in northeastern Utah, guiding youth through its wild mountain and desert backcountry, where some of the most memorable experiences involved cooking dinner and sharing stories around a campfire. A desire to share her connection to certain landscapes with others through food, writing, visual storytelling, and direct experience has informed her career. She joined the Gold Ridge Organic Farms team in 2021 and manages digital marketing, sales, and creative development. Naomi especially enjoys collaborating with local makers to create products and experiences that showcase the bounty and natural beauty of Sonoma County.",

    "Farmer Bios":"While his love of food and obsession with gardening blossomed during his decade at The French Laundry, Aaron Keefer saw his extensive plant knowledge as a stepping stone in a path to cultivate his other favorite flora: cannabis. Every day he witnessed the fruits of his meticulous labor delivered to the most discerning palates in Chef Thomas Keller’s three Michelin star dining room, and he knew that someday he could bring the same passion with quality and care and apply it to growing cannabis.\n\nIn the restaurant world Keefer built a reputation as one of the most respected gardeners in the industry. As Culinary Gardener for some of the finest restaurants in the world, Aaron collaborated with celebrated Chef Thomas Keller and his culinary teams at several Keller establishments to harvest and supply the highest quality produce in the industry. It was under the Thomas Keller Group that Aaron fully realized the true potential of ingredient sourcing and how the foundation of a great kitchen is built upon the walls of the garden.\n\nAaron’s green thumb and passion for the land emerged at a young age. His earliest memories include picking sun-warmed strawberries from his grandfather’s farm in upstate New York at age where he practiced sustainable farming methods and learned to listen to the rhythms of nature. From hand picking fields of berries to tossing hay bales during the summers as a teen, the agriculture life always resonated with Keefer. However, it was the smell of his grandmother’s cooking his recently harvested onions and beans that fully made him realize the full sensory experience that gardening could deliver.\n\nUpon graduating from the Culinary Institute of America, Aaron moved to California and began his restaurant career at the Marin Country Club, where he rose quickly to the roles of Executive Chef and Food and Beverage Director. Through the past years, he has also legally cultivated medicinal cannabis. It was after he sought a career defining opportunity and began his tenure at The French Laundry that Keefer began to recognize his opportunity to grow professionally. Chef Keller’s insistence upon ingredient quality led Keefer to train in the culinary garden, where he rekindled his childhood love with cultivation, and provided him an opportunity to reconnect with botany on a professional level. more here: https:\/\/sonomahillsfarm.com\/people\/ ",

    "Farmer Bios":"Paul Bernier was raised in the suburbs south of San Francisco and came to Dry Creek Valley in the early 70’s to work as a farm hand in a prune orchard. He worked during the transition from tree crops to grapes in the Dry Creek Valley.  In 1976, he started farming on his own by sharecropping small pieces of land.\n​\nPaul’s mechanical talent allows the farm to do very well with old equipment that he adapts or refurbishes. His most interesting and innovative creation is the compost turner he built for their composting operation that supplies the needs of their land.                                  Yael Bernier moved to Sonoma County in the 60’s, bought a goat, and started farming. At that time, her Italian Swiss neighbor, Mrs. Lucchini, gave Yael some Northern Italian Red garlic seed. After more than 35 years of garlic farming, Yael now grows 14 different varieties of garlic.                  Zureal Bernier was born and raised on the home ranch and grew up dividing his time between surfing, skateboarding, school, and working in the fields. He went on to earn a degree in agriculture from Cal Poly State University in San Luis Obispo. After college, Zureal worked in fruit crops on a Cal Poly farm and later in row crops for a Sonoma County organic vegetable grower.  Later, he worked for a couple of years farming on his own before joining the family farm. Zureal and his wife, Anna, now live with their three children on the home ranch in Geyserville.                    Miguel Campos Madrigal is our longest standing employee; he's been with us for over 15 years. Miguel mostly spends his days in the vineyards that we farm. He knows all our practices like the back of his hand and has a natural ability in all things agricultural. He also is our connection to a great crew of men who get us through grape harvest every year.",

When the Saichow family immigrated to the Bay Area in 1989, they brought along their values of self-sufficiency and generosity and continued to grow Southeast Asian vegetables in their backyard for themselves and their neighbors.\n\nThis powerful connection between food and community led her parents San and Muang back into farming, and in 2011, with Koy’s help, they opened Stony Point Strawberry Farm: a 10-acre organic farm located in beautiful sun-soaked Petaluma, specializing in, you guessed it, berries. Koy manages the business side of the farm while San and Muang focus their efforts on their passion: growing some of the best strawberries in Sonoma County.",

For more than ?20 years, he’s worked the farm with a love and passion for growing produce that equaled Malcolm and Nancy Skall’s, the owners who first employed him.\n\nWhile Malcolm Skall’s death in 1999 left Nancy Skall working the property as sole owner, Sam Calderón never failed to support the aging woman, until her death in January 2015, too, brought more changes to the farm. Skall’s daughters kept Calderón on the property and treated him fairly during the interim. He’s stayed in contact with them.\n\nMiddleton Farm is now owned by Annie and Montgomery Woods, who purchased the tract from Skall’s daughters, and Sam Calderón, 41, continues to be chief farmer of his beloved property. The farm is an 8-acre treasure of rich alluvial soil near the confluence of Mill and Felta creeks. Riparian habitat is filled with birds whose calls echo across the property.",

    "Farmer Bios":"Raised in rural Minnesota on a 350-acre “funny farm” filled with exotic animals, Landy was born to be in agriculture. His family was one of the pioneers of full-integrity farming when they switched to organic practices in 1997, and he has been pursuing sustainable, full-circle farming ever since.\n\nLandy moved to California in 2009 and spent time working for Gott’s Roadside and Eierman Consulting. In 2013 he founded Landarosa Farms in Vacaville, which was the featured farm at the renowned Tower Dinner in Sacramento in 2018.\n\nLandy has a wide range of agricultural expertise—from beekeeping, to poultry science, to soil health. A product of Colorado College where he studied Philosophy and Economics, exploring both the “why” and “how” of farming, Landy is educating the next generation through an internship program through UC Davis because, as he says, “the world needs more organic farmers.”",

    "Farmer Bios":"Owners since 2000, Brian Sullivan and Gayle Okumura Sullivan dedicated the farm to organic stone fruit; broadened the product line to include peach jam, cobbler mix, and other products; introduced Dry Creek Peaches to customers and partners including Chez Panisse and Bryan’s; and re-opened the farm stand in the summer.  The Sullivans manage the overall operations of the farm in conjunction with Eusebio Sayago and his family.  Throughout the year we are either working the soil or the trees to develop the orchard and to create the healthiest possible environment. Everything we use is certified organic. Before we begin the summer harvest, many hours have been spent on each individual tree--pruning, fortifying, thinning, and cultivating.  \n\n\n\n",

    "Farmer Bios":"Leslie Wiser was born in Chicago and grew up across the Midwest, spending her formative years in St. Paul, Cleveland, and Indianapolis. In her early 20s, she worked a season on a 10-acre organic farm in Palmer, Alaska, where her passion for regenerative agriculture began to flourish. As a first-generation, mixed-race woman of Chinese-Taiwanese, German, and Polish Jewish descent, Leslie often found her story and cultural heritage underrepresented in mainstream society and American agricultural spaces. This lack of representation has fueled her ongoing exploration of her multifaceted heritage through her work and personal pursuits.\nWhen Leslie became a mother, she envisioned food as a bridge to connect her children to their Korean Chinese-Taiwanese roots. This vision inspired her to create Radical Family Farms, the realization of a 20-year dream to farm and a meaningful step in her lifelong journey of self-discovery.",

She frequented the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market, and her interest in food and land stewardship grew. In 2010, she started Trees of Life in Sonoma County, drawn to the plot’s biodiversity and potential for growing fruit. Rachel’s farming philosophy, partly informed by her ecological farming education, is to work with, not against, the climate and landscape of the farm. She found her land and its Goldridge soil to be suitable for growing apples. Rachel grows special heirloom and locally developed apple varieties, along with Asian pears, quince, and small amounts of other tree fruit.",

What began as an interest in home gardening became a passion-monster! Over the course of a Master’s and PhD program at Davis she continued to learn, teach and eventually research at the Student Farm. After completing that research she left Davis with valuable horticultural skills and sustainable ag as a vocation. A number of experiences later (a highlight of which was reviving and managing the Putah Creek Cafe Garden in the middle of beloved Winters, CA), the opportunity to start Sunray came along. She gets inspired by approaching farming as holistic community development. ",

    "Additional Information":"Seven Grandfathers Farm is located in beautiful Kelsey, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in California. We were the first farm in El Dorado County to be certified organic, over 40 years ago! Here we grow a variety of fruits and vegetables on two acres, specializing in delicious and unique varieties of heirloom and specialty crops that we have discovered over a lifetime of organic growing. All our produce is 100 percent free from chemical pesticides, artificial chemical fertilizers, and is GMO-free. Our goal is to grow the most delicious, healthiest, and most nutritious produce possible. It all begins with healthy, fertile soil. Plants grown in rich and vibrant soil naturally produce more nutritious crops, and are better able to ward off insect and disease attacks. We make our own compost from plant materials here on the farm, and we rotate plantings with legume cover crops that supply nitrogen and other nutrients. We utilize natural mulches and use drip irrigation to conserve water. We are always striving to find better ways to produce an abundant harvest while minimizing our impact on the natural environment. The wildlife that share our home are important to us, and our practices encourage abundant numbers of bees, butterflies, and birds that do their part to pollinate and patrol for insect pests. Our water comes from our own well, deep in the foothills of the mountains. We have abundant sunshine and summer heat, ensuring that our fruits, berries, squash, melons, kale, lettuce, beets, peppers, and tomatoes are extra sweet. Our hilltop location is ideal for air circulation and maintaining a long growing season. You can definitely taste the difference!",

    "Farmer Bios":"Located in Winton, CA, Arnold Farms is a family owned farm that was established in 1909. Current partners are father\/son duo, William “Bill” Arnold (3rd generation farmer) and Craig Arnold (4th generation farmer). Bill previously farmed the ranch with his brother, Glenn, who passed away in 2019. \n\nCraig was born and raised on the farm and has stepped up as partner alongside his dad. Together they are a truly dynamic duo. They are active in the Atwater, Winton and Merced communities and are excited to share their farming adventure with a wider audience. \n\nHere at Arnold Farms or “Sweet AF”, we farm around 1200 acres of crops. There’s always something going on around the farm year-round as we grow a variety of different crops, including but not limited to: Organic and Conventional Sweet Potatoes, Cling and Freestone Peaches, Almonds, Merced Rye, Organic Pomegranates and Wine Grapes. We also rent wooden and plastic bins used in fruit and vegetable harvest. \n\nIn 2021, we had an idea to bring our farming history and culture to the masses, with a twist. “Sweet AF” was just a long running joke within our small crew, but when COVID hit and markets plummeted, everyone around us realized farming was not going to cut it anymore as a standalone. From that inside joke, \"Sweet AF” blossomed into an actual real life venture which launched in May of 2022. Here at Arnold Farms or “Sweet AF”, there’s always something going on around the farm year-round as we grow a variety of different crops, including but not limited to: Organic and Conventional Sweet Potatoes, Cling and Freestone Peaches, Almonds, Merced Rye, Organic Pomegranates and Wine Grapes. \n\n“The Sweet Spot” is our newest little adventure. July of 2024, just in time for fresh peaches, we opened our farm store that gives you a convienent place to shop several local businesses including Burroughs Family Farms, Vintage Farm Suds, Blackwood Brittle, GT Bee’s Honey, A & G Jams, Simply Modern Co. and many more!

    "Additional Information":"Inzana Ranch and Produce is a 200 acre organic farm in Hughson where we grow a variety of crops, ranging from stone fruits to citruses. We’ve always grown produce and planted trees, vines, and vegetables that we enjoy working with, eating and sharing. It seems like we’re constantly harvesting something with the amount of produce we grow on our ranch but the thrill of farming isn’t gone! We feel as though we’re learning something new everyday and we’re always in pursuit of that perfect fruit, be it an apple, fig, or tangerine. Inzana Ranch is celebrating our thirtieth year of farming. We fell in love with a run-down Victorian house built in 1980 and transformed the neglected property into a functioning farm. Our house is one of the last representations of the late nineteenth century, pre-irrigated wheat ranches still existing in Stanislaus County today. We attend twelve farmers’ markets a week and enjoy very much interacting with our customers. We’re immersed in every facet of our ranch; we pick, prune, clean, pack, process, encourage, help, share, and love the whole darn thing together. Famously Fresh Fruits! Decidedly Delicious Nuts! All Organically Grown!",

    "Farmer Bios":"The Durst family has been farming in the Yolo county area of California since the late 1800's. While the previous three generations focused on large-scale commodity crop farming, Jim and Deborah Durst have become known for their focus on fresh market organic produce. They planted their very first organic crop, processing tomatoes, for Muir Glen in 1988. They soon branched out to other crops like organic alfalfa, sunflowers, sugar beets, and grain. By 1989 they were growing their first organic, fresh market tomatoes and mixed melons, which they sold into Bay Area markets. Since then, they have continued to grow a mix of organic fresh market and commodity crops. Along the way they have added a few other Durst favorites, including their asparagus, which they first planted in 1997. In 2000 Durst Organic Growers discontinued growing processing tomatoes, and decided to instead focus on fresh market heirloom and cherry varieties along with asparagus, melons, and squash.\n\nFrom the beginning, Jim and Deborah have worked hard to build a conscious, ecologically minded business where both people and planet are treated respectfully. They care deeply about the health and wellbeing of their consumers and employees and consider this greatly when making every little decision in the growing of their crops. When you taste Durst produce, we hope you can taste the difference, because as Jim says, “If it doesn’t taste good, what's the point?”",

We farm 30 acres of certified organic land in a little valley called the Hungry Hollow in Northern California. They started farming in 1976 after both graduating from UC Davis and decided they wanted to live on the land and be self sufficient.\n\nThe love of growing food, living on the less traveled path and doing something meaningful came from generations of strong-minded individuals. Cooperation, communities, social change, food movement and land stewardship have been their guiding beliefs in one form or another since the 1970's.\n\nAlison and Claire returned to the farm to help run the family business. As of 2021 Good Humus became a partnership with the five of us working together.",

When not struggling to live with the consequences of poor farming judgments, they are battling seasonal weather anomalies and Acts of God, resisting the onslaught of runaway bureaucracy and the concomitant regulatory compliance issues, cursing the constipated internet, and wondering why there are no Blues songs about farming.

We use sustainable, regenerative certified organic farming practices to ensure we are good stewards of our land. We grow and sell only our own California almonds. We devote 100% of our farming time towards our 1400 trees to produce high quality organic almonds for you. All equipment used is certified organic and free of other tree nuts, peanuts, grains etc. Our almonds are always properly stored on site in a temperature and humidity controlled storeroom.\n\n \n\nOur farm is unique. Unlike conventional orchards that harvest onto the ground, we harvest off-ground. The hydro-mechanical shaker head is built into a catch frame tarp system. This tarp system avoids the typical dusty, dirty operation of sweeping nuts off the dirty orchard floor (ground). This virtually eliminates any chance of salmonella and provides greater food safety and cleanliness for our customers. Therefore we can safely offer the best unpasteurized raw organic almonds for your raw foods diet. We do not mix organic and conventional products or farming methods.",

    "Farmer Bios":" In keeping with the classic farming traditions of Greece, Sotories Filandrianos was an architect and designer of vineyards that produced some of the finest grapes in Greece.  Filandrianos began farming his own land with naturally grown vegetables.  Most farms were small with four or five acres of land. Farmers grew enough food to support their families and, at times, they grew a small surplus to sell at the local market. \nThis tradition was passed down the family line to his son Angelo and eventually to his grandson, Tony. \nAngelo, came to the US and started a landscape business in the High Dessert where he also continued with the lineage of growing crops in the naturally grown traditions. Originally, he started with 5 acres, but over the last 40 years has increased the farm size to an additional 20 acres.\nBack in Greece, Sotories Filandrianos had always grown his crops organically and this has been carried down to the present day, including catching rain water in barrels for irrigation and composting completed crops and any unsold vegetables.  These traditions have always served naturally grown farmers well and proved to produce a crop that excels in nutrition as well as keeping the land in its original productive state. \nThe farm is tended every day by the Filandrianos, and all the crops are hand-picked and fresh when you see them at the Farmer’s Market.  Angelo's Farms has grown to extended farm locations such as Newberry Springs, Yucaipa and Thermal CA. ",

One of the first females to lead a wholesale organic produce company, Elvia has dedicated her career to the agricultural sector, having co-founded the successful Double D Farms, which began as an almond grower in 1986.\n\nDouble D Farms started growing organically in the early 1990s, as Don and Elvia Devine explored the burgeoning organic movement. Today, Double D Farms employs more than 500 people in California, Sonora, and Baja California.\n\nAgriculture remains one of the few male-dominated industries in the USA, but Elvia’s passion for great tasting, sustainable produce and her strategic vision for Double D Farms has seen her take a hands-on role across each stage of the business’ operations. From picking to packing and shipping, she is committed to growing the amount of organic food produced in the USA and stocked by retailers around the world–giving everyone access to produce grown in a healthier and more sustainable manner.",

    "Farmer Bios":"Benzler Farms, a 250-acre farm in Fresno CA, was started by Fred and Bertha Benzler in 1952. Committed to protecting the environment, Fred was so eager to avoid waste that he would reuse a napkin for lunch and dinner. His ecological consideration guided how the farm was managed from day one.\n\nWhile the family always valued food free of pesticides and other synthetic chemicals, the farm became officially certified organic in the 1980’s. Today it is owned and operated by Thomas Benzler, who carries on his grandparents’ traditions of farming. Offering their grapes in compostable paper tote bags is another way of showing care for the Earth.\n\nBenzler Farms operates under the mantra, “first, last, and only.” They provide some of the first oranges of the season, as well as some of the last. They are also the sole providers of a few rare types of produce in the area, such as Star Ruby and Cara Cara oranges. These unique varieties of produce, as well as the ability to harvest across the season, has helped them stand out.\n\nDuring harvesting, Benzler Farms pre-cools all produce, then packs and ships in a matter of hours; they guarantee taste, freshness, without compromise of shelf life. Veritable Vegetable is proud of the relationship we have had with all three generations of the Benzler family.",

Really, we don’t think that the first two are possible without the latter.\n\nMany of our Biodynamic practices are a return to age-old farming methods. We make our own compost and preparations (homeopathic plant materials that stimulate plant growth and health), and we grow a diverse range of fruit and vegetables that thrive in the 12-month-a-year growing season of the Central Valley. Our commitment to Biodynamic farming involves a spiritual component and some serious elbow grease. We also use biodynamically inspired Festival sprays to honor the earth that supports us.",

As not only owners but residents of the farm, our family's views on the value of natural agriculture are especially informed. For the sake of our own health and the health of our workers and local environment, we made the decision long ago that we didn't want to follow “conventional” growing practices. The farm has officially been certified organic by CCOF since 2006",

    "Farmer Bios":"Stroll onto Vern Peterson’s farm, appropriately named Abundant Harvest Organics (AHO) in Kingsburg, CA and you’ll feel the song of work, the buzz of farm activity, the tractor rolling through the rows, and a melody… a bit of an old hymn, sung by owner, Vernon Peterson, as he moves about his ranch. If there is a man that is characterized by a musical note, a beaming smile, and an open heart, it’s Vernon Peterson. Him and his wife, Carol, plus their kids Erik and Heather (and their own growing families), from the Peterson Family and Abundant Harvest Organics.\n\nProud of their Swedish heritage, the Peterson’s have owned and farmed this land for many, many years.\n\n“In four generations we’ve only moved a quarter of a mile,” Vernon declares, a large smile spreading across his face as he gazes out at his orchard. “I’ve been farming for thirty-one years; I started at age five, out in the field, grading cannery peaches, across the street from where I live now. My dad farmed tree fruit, grapes, and chickens. We all pitched in. That’s just how a family farm works. I never thought of my dad as having a different occupation from me! We all just worked the farm. Dad allowed us boys to work, make mistakes, and learn from them. From him I learned so much, but, mostly, he was a genuine man. He loved life and loved to help people. In fact, in a nutshell, that’s what we do on this farm today.”",

This family owned and operated farm specializes in organically grown specialty grapes and mandarins.\n\nPushing for more natural and organic products requires thinking beyond the conventional farming approach. More importantly, it takes a commitment of time to enact sustainable practices every single day. We feel that this commitment-tough as it might be-produces amazing fruit well worth the effort.",

The ranch was established as a dairy in 1938. John had grown up on the farm during the years his father ran it as a dairy and fruit farm, and had taken over running the ranch right out of high school 10 years earlier. But, even with all that experience, growing food organically required learning an entirely new approach to farming.\n\n“In the early days, there wasn’t a lot of university support for organics. Anything the organic growers were learning was on their own, through experience basically, or researching like I did by reading really old publications,” John recalled. “We’d get together, and we’d go over things: what works, what doesn’t, sharing what we were doing on our own farms. It was interesting, it was fun.”",

    "Additional Information":"RW Sweeties is a family owned & operated certified organic mandarin orange farm in Reedley, Tulare County, CA. We have been farmers since we were kids. Our dad, Ronald W. Whisenant, taught us early on the value of hard work &\ndetermination. 4H & FFA taught us the education, discipline, business & organizational skills we needed to run our family\nfarm business. When we received this orchard in 2009, upon our fathers untimely passing we decided that we would farm it as a family in his honor & fulfill his dream of growing the sweetest organic mandarins & sharing them with other families to enjoy. \n\nAs of 11\/15\/2021 our organic certification was completed. We hire certified sub-contractors to prune, weed, fertilize & control pests in our orchard with strict organic standards. We contract with a certified organic picker\/hauler\/packer (usually Moonlight Packing & they sell our fruit as the brand name “Cuties”) We inspect our orchard weekly & we all eat the fruit we grow…even our grandbabies! We maintain a Facebook web presence to spread the word about how amazing & healthy mandarins are with nutrition values, storage tips & recipes that embellish their value.",

In fact, Jess Quinlan was grabbing a burrito at El Charito in Salinas when he met Tony Alameda standing in line. They struck up a conversation and two years later, the Alameda’s and Jess founded Sábor Farms in 2006. Since that time the company has grown from a handful of employees to several hundred, finding their place in the market with niche crops that most people wouldn’t think to farm. We are constantly finding new ways to improve our operations, as specialty crops are often difficult for conventional farmers to grow.\n\nBoth the Alameda and Quinlan family are deeply rooted in the Salinas Valley and Yuma, making community an important value to Sábor Farms. We foster a culture where we treat our coworkers like family, our partners with integrity, and most of all, we aim to bring our customers together with unique and healthy vegetables.",

    "Farmer Bios":"With a family legacy of farming, Reiter Affiliated Companies (RAC) is proud to be the largest fresh, multi-berry producer in the world and the leading supplier of fresh strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries in all of North America. The Reiter family began farming in the San Francisco Bay Peninsula and by the turn of the century had migrated south into Watsonville and the Santa Clara Valley where Joseph “Ed” Reiter and R.F. “Dick” Driscoll began growing their own Sweetbriar strawberries variety. After World War II, they farmed under their respective companies of Reiter and Driscoll’s and began marketing strawberries under the Driscoll Strawberry Associates label with other family and associated suppliers.\n\nThroughout the early years, Ed’s son Joseph chartered new agricultural territories up until the late 1970’s when Garland and Miles Reiter, grandsons of Ed Reiter, began working in the family business, developing operations and planting new varieties in California. The brother’s continued to not only preserve their family legacy of farming but grew the company to be one of the nation’s leaders in the agricultural industry. Since that time, the brothers have increased the Reiter Affiliated Companies (RAC) investment, farming and pioneering new plant varieties, developing new geographies and offering new commodities to consumers. With this innovative approach to farming and agriculture, RAC’s business has doubled every five years over the past twenty five, supported by a strategy of sustained growth. Newly formed partnerships and unique grower empowered revenue share programs drove business development geographically in the early 1990’s to RAC’s broader footprint today.\n\nAt the heart of the success of this multi-generational farming company, has been the ownership’s fervent belief in their fundamental values and guiding principles. Honesty, Fairness and Respect are framed along the corridors of every office, from the smallest ranch operation in remote locations to their corporate offices in Oxnard. These values have been integrated into every aspect of the company, defining a clear path for integrity to flow throughout the organization. From the humble fields by which their family legacy was born, to the people that represent the Reiter Affiliated Companies today, the successful partnership of two cousins led to a family legacy of farming spanning more than a century long, with geographies that exist today throughout the United States, Mexico, Europe, Northern Africa, Peru, and Canada.",

Soon our roots were firmly planted in Salinas, California, and our family of growers developed. We describe ourselves as grower-centric due to our long-standing, established relationships with our growing partners - some we have been with since our inception. Our programs span throughout central and southern California, extend into Yuma and Maricopa County, in Arizona, and reach down to Mexico. We choose our growing regions for their fertile soil and temperate weather. This regional diversity enables us to offer a continuous supply of fresh, premium broccoli, cauliflower, lettuce, and other fresh row crops throughout the year. \nPacific has always been an employee-owned company. This means many key members of our sales and management teams are not only actively involved in our daily operations but are the main decision-makers in the business. This offers us a unique perspective creating a culture of innovation and collaboration. Our dedicated employees are the backbone of who we are. Many  have been with us for over 15 years. Their unwavering commitment, passion, and hard work are the driving force behind everything we do.\n\nTom passed away in 2017 and our leadership adjusted to include David Black as the new Vice President. Pacific remains steady in our original vision, using it as a guiding principle as we navigate the future.  Supported by the strong leadership duo of Dave and David, the continuing relationships with our growing partners, and the dedication of our employees, we are forever committed to providing you with the safest, freshest, and finest produce that nature has to offer, straight from the fields.\n\n",

    "Farmer Bios":"With a family legacy of farming, Reiter Affiliated Companies (RAC) is proud to be the largest fresh, multi-berry producer in the world and the leading supplier of fresh strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries in all of North America. The Reiter family began farming in the San Francisco Bay Peninsula and by the turn of the century had migrated south into Watsonville and the Santa Clara Valley where Joseph “Ed” Reiter and R.F. “Dick” Driscoll began growing their own Sweetbriar strawberries variety. After World War II, they farmed under their respective companies of Reiter and Driscoll’s and began marketing strawberries under the Driscoll Strawberry Associates label with other family and associated suppliers.\n\nThroughout the early years, Ed’s son Joseph chartered new agricultural territories up until the late 1970’s when Garland and Miles Reiter, grandsons of Ed Reiter, began working in the family business, developing operations and planting new varieties in California. The brother’s continued to not only preserve their family legacy of farming but grew the company to be one of the nation’s leaders in the agricultural industry. Since that time, the brothers have increased the Reiter Affiliated Companies (RAC) investment, farming and pioneering new plant varieties, developing new geographies and offering new commodities to consumers. With this innovative approach to farming and agriculture, RAC’s business has doubled every five years over the past twenty five, supported by a strategy of sustained growth. Newly formed partnerships and unique grower empowered revenue share programs drove business development geographically in the early 1990’s to RAC’s broader footprint today.\n\nAt the heart of the success of this multi-generational farming company, has been the ownership’s fervent belief in their fundamental values and guiding principles. Honesty, Fairness and Respect are framed along the corridors of every office, from the smallest ranch operation in remote locations to their corporate offices in Oxnard. These values have been integrated into every aspect of the company, defining a clear path for integrity to flow throughout the organization. From the humble fields by which their family legacy was born, to the people that represent the Reiter Affiliated Companies today, the successful partnership of two cousins led to a family legacy of farming spanning more than a century long, with geographies that exist today throughout the United States, Mexico, Europe, Northern Africa, Peru, and Canada.",

    "Farmer Bios":"Floyd had a profound passion for life and the people that lived and worked by his side. Those that had the pleasure of working with him were nothing less than inspired. He exemplified a Modern Pioneer and what a founder should be (we still have the boots to remind ourselves, 25+year-old dirt and all). He felt there was a place in the Salinas Valley for a produce company that could succeed while treating its people with respect and he always balanced the choice between growth and quality. He was proven right through his decisions and we intend to continue in his bootsteps.\n\nStemming from the love of leafy greens to organics, but most importantly those that tend to the land. We continue to implement new technologies that focus on comprehensive long-term ethical growing, processing and harvesting practices that will not harm our people or our environment. We recognize that the work of producing food is still one of the hardest, most important and complex livelihoods – one that directly impacts every person, every day of the year.\n\n",

    "Farmer Bios":"Rodriguez Farms started in 1991 with 3 acres of strawberries in Watsonville, California along the Monterey Bay coast. This was a dream come true since I had been working at farmers’ markets for my dad's employer since high school. My husband was working for a strawberry farm and had some experience growing berries in Mexico before coming to the United States. With our experience and ambition to start our own business we took a chance and ventured into the farming world.\n\nSince 2004 we have been certified organic with C.C.O.F and U.S.D.A. Every year we test and make changes to use natural farming practices. We are proud to say we have developed a tractor mounted vacuum system to remove pests from our plants and avoid using harmful pesticides. We also grow other plants that are beneficial to organic farming. Since we started our goal has been to grow quality fruit and offer the best to our customers. Every year we learn and make changes to ensure we are growing the best berries and it helps to be farming in the best soil and weather for strawberries. Our business depends on our customers and we have been very successful at farmers’ markets. Our customers return year after year and our new fans have helped us grow to a 120 acre farm split between Watsonville and Castroville overlooking the Monterey Bay. We plant an average of 60 acres per year in order to let the other half of our soil rest. This allows the soil to replenish its nutrients and produce better quality crop. Due to customer demand we have also added a wide variety of berries and vegetables. ",

    "Farmer Bios":"Though we welcome limited-resource farmers from all backgrounds, the vast majority who knock on our ALBA’s door are Mexican immigrants seeking a chance at a better life. The productivity of large scale growers in the Salinas Valley makes it the ‘Salad Bowl to the World’, generating $4 billion in crop sales for the predominantly large-scale growers. The sector employs over 50,000 workers, but many of these jobs are held by Mexican immigrant farmworkers, who are paid between $20 and $30 thousand per year without job security or benefits. They are often disregarded as ‘unskilled labor’, but their talent and work ethic make them capable of much more if given the opportunity.\n\nALBA is focused on economic opportunity for field laborers whose farming experience, work ethic and entrepreneurial drive make them capable of higher achievement if given the opportunity. In fact, ALBA is a showcase for what immigrant farmworkers can do if given access to resources and education. Disregarding them as ‘unskilled labor’ ignores the fact that agriculture is highly dependent on their work and that they seem to be the only people willing and able to do it.\n\nTo deal with the farm labor shortage, large growers are scrambling to mechanize their way out of the problem. But the strategy is highly reliant on machinery, pesticides, and a global export strategy, which negatively impact worker and environmental health, and has wreaked havoc on the American family farm. There are arguments for this style of farming in terms of higher crop yields, lower production cost, which translates to food affordability.",

The Borba's have been farming for four generations, beginning with apricot orchards back in the late 1800’s. Ron’s parents, George and Sadie Borba, grew and dried Blenheim Apricots on the same land farmed today. Ron started expanding with bush berries, apples, and squash. After starting farmers markets in 1993, he slowly began experimenting with specialty produce and varieties. Ron, his wife Cindy, and their four kids specialize in growing a wide variety of certified organic produce year-round on their acreage in both Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties.

    "Farmer Bios":"Sierra Valley Farms is a 65-acre certified organic farm and nursery situated on the Middle Fork of the Feather River in the majestic Sierra Valley. The farm, located at 5,000 feet elevation, in Beckwourth California, has one of the most unique growing climates in the West. Sierra Valley Farms was first established as a native plant nursery in 1990 and broadened its diversity to growing certified organic produce in 1999.\n\nThe family farm is owned and operated by Gary Romano. Sierra Valley Farms diverse operation includes growing and production of a wide range of cool-season vegetables and some fruits, micro greens, herbs, hops, and value-added condiments. The farm hosts an “on-farm” farmers market, restaurant CSA’s, and “Dinners in the Barn”.\n\nSierra Valley Farms markets most of their products by way of Farmers Markets in the Reno\/Tahoe area, and hosts the only On-farm Certified Farmers Market in California. The farm products are very popular in the community markets and also popular is the unique CSA program just for restaurants.\n\nThe historic farm once owned by Gary’s grandparents goes back three generations in Sierra Valley and hosts corrals with many years of composted manures and organic matter. The Romano’s utilize the natural dynamics of cover crops, rotation of crops, wildlife intrusion, and the four seasons to enhance the already fertile soil. This, along with the cool summer climate produces some of the finest quality organic vegetables in the world…includes: spring mix, romaine, arugula, kale, spinach, radishes, carrots, babbage, broccoli, garlic, beets, asparagus, hemp and hops.\n\nSierra Valley has one of the harshest climates in the Sierras with winter temperatures of sometimes below zero and only 60-70 frost-free days per year. The summers daily temperatures can fluctuate as much as 50 degrees with morning lows in the30’s and afternoon as high as the ’80s-’90s. \n\nSierra Valley Farms is proud of its commitment to the sustainability of the family farm. They continue to diversify their farm operations and support agrotourism with the many events held on the farm.",

    "Farmer Bios":"Rava Ranches Inc. is a family-owned and operated produce company that uses sustainable agricultural practices to produce safe, high quality produce while minimizing the environmental impact on the land so that its employees and customers can maintain a high quality of life.\nGerolamo Rava came to Gonzales, California in 1924 from Lake Como, Italy. He started his own dairy, and raised beef cattle and feed in Monterey County. He helped construct the First Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Greenfield, was a member of the Salinas Elks Lodge, Monterey Farm Bureau, and Sons of Italy. Gerolamo was a generous man, who always lent a helping hand.\nSecond generation California farmer, Jerry Sr, was raised in Greenfield in an Italian tradition. Jerry started farming in the 50's after a stent in the Navy. Crops and equipment have evolved a long way since the 1950's and beans and sugar beets have given way to fresh vegetables and wine grapes. Third generation California farmer, Jerry II, grew up farming along side his father and always knew he wanted to follow in his footsteps. He joined his father after graduation from Cal Poly, to expand the family business into Arizona and Southern California to build a year-round enterprise and increase the amount of acreage farmed and the variety of crops.\nThird Generation California Farmer, Chad, had a love for the land at an early age. Chad manages the family's wine grapes in Monterey and San Luis Obispo Counties. Chad focuses on growing superior quality grapes while giving back to the land which he plans on passing down to future generations.",

    "Farmer Bios":"In 1997 Jamie Collins was at a crossroads. Trained as a social worker, she was living in Southern California, working with mentally disabled adults and struggling with burnout. Her Plan B, interior design, didn’t seem exciting anymore. She wanted work that mattered “in the big scheme of things,” and it needed to be work that would sustain her, not drain her, on a day-to-day basis.\n\nAfter work Jamie would come home and tend to the many plants she had growing on her patio—tomatoes, grapes and herbs, to name a few. When an internship as a furniture designer fell through after she’d already given notice at her social work job, Jamie decided it was an opportune time to take a road trip with her dog Ziggy and see the rest of the West Coast. The diversity of crops she rolled past on her coastal trip inspired her next move: enrollment in the Crop and Fruit Science program at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo the following semester. “I felt good about growing plants that could feed people,” she says, “not just make someone’s yard look pretty.”",

    "Farmer Bios":"Isabel Rosas and her husband, Isaias, worked in agriculture for over 20 years as farmworkers before starting their own venture. During these years, Isabel and Isaias not only learned the craft of farming, but also experienced the challenges of large-scale, conventional agriculture – namely, low pay for farmworkers and detrimental farming practices. Inspired to build a livelihood and home for their budding family, Isabel and Isaias enrolled in business and farming classes at ALBA. Eventually they started Dream Farm to grow fresh, nutritious produce on land leased from ALBA. As their farm has grown, so too has Isabel’s confidence; at first, the prospect of managing both the field and business aspects of the farm, especially while trying to balance family life, intimidated her. However, with support from her husband and community alongside her own perseverance and dedication, Isabel now feels capable and confident in her business, handling the administrative and sales components while her husband oversees production. \n\nIn 2024, Isabel and her husband are searching for their own land where they can continue their farm operation, hoping to deepen into more organic practices, nourish the land, and enhance natural systems. Eventually, Isabel and Isaias hope to create a fully self-sufficient and sustainable farm and ranch ecosystem that can support their family completely, and provide a safe and inspiring environment where their children can grow up.

    "Farmer Bios":" In 2003 my wife and soul mate, Barbara, and I moved on to a 93 acre ranch in mid Carmel Valley, California, with our dogs and cats and managed to keep everyone content in a very small trailer until we finished building a portion of our ranch house. After recently retiring from the retail nursery business I wanted to  fulfill my dream of becoming a real farmer and olive trees and their fruit seemed like a perfect fit.  This 'Mediterranean like' environment is very well suited for grapes and olives with shallow topsoil covering fractured Monterey shale coupled with deep ancient well water, abundant sunshine, occasional fog and typical Pacific Ocean coastal influences.\n \n  In early 2004 we planted our first 1000 Tuscan olive trees on the south facing hillsides of the valley.  Following those first plantings came another 1000 and in addition to achieving sustainability we also installed a solar system and became certified as ORGANIC EXTRA VIRGIN.\n \n  All of our work on this ranch is done by hand and the only machinery used is at the mill where we take our freshly picked fruit and process it within 12 hours of harvest.\n \n  The Tuscan varietals that we grow are Taggiasca, Maurino, and Pendolino.  The Taggiasca is our primary producer that yields a very distinguished flavorful oil that is typically found in the Liguria region of northern Italy.  Our Maurino olives produce a very robust oil that complements our field blend with the result being a peppery finish from this oil in the back of your throat.  Under our hands on philosophy the trees have flourished and annually produce a clean, fresh, and very healthy extra virgin olive oil.  We encourage our customers to taste TRES OSOS along side other olive oils and witness first hand a true California olive oil.",

    "Farmer Bios":"María Luz Reyes and her husband, Florentino Collazo, run La Milpa Organic Farm on land they lease from the Agriculture & Land Based Training Association (ALBA) near Salinas, California. They grow 5.5 acres of mixed vegetable crops that they sell at farmers’ markets in the Salinas, Monterey Bay, and San Francisco Bay areas.\n\nCollazo was born in 1963 in the municipality of Purísima del Rincón, in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico. He studied agricultural engineering at the college level in Mexico. Reyes was born in the state of Jalisco, Mexico, in 1965. Due to difficult economic times in Mexico, they decided to immigrate to the United States under the Amnesty Law of 1985. Collazo worked harvesting and packaging lettuce in Yuma, Arizona, and in the Salinas and Imperial Valleys of California. Reyes worked off and on at an asparagus packing facility. Eventually Collazo enrolled in a six-month course at the Agriculture & Land-Based Training Association known as the Programa Educativo para Pequeños Agricultores, or PEPA, in 1995. In 2003, Reyes also enrolled in that program. After graduating, Collazo worked for eight years as the field educator\/farm manager for ALBA, and Reyes continued to farm on land she leased from ALBA.\n\n \n\nCollazo left ALBA to farm full time with Reyes on ten acres of land they purchased together in southern Monterey County. They have run La Milpa Organic Farm for the past six years and are certified organic by California Certified Organic Farmers. The financing to purchase their land in South Monterey County came through the help of an Individual Development Account organized by California FarmLink and a beginning-farmer farm loan through the Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency. Reyes and Collazo also continue to farm 5.5 acres of land they rent from ALBA.\n\nOn their farm—named La Milpa in tribute to traditional MesoAmerican methods of growing many diverse crops closely together—Reyes and Collazo cultivate over thirty crops, including fifteen varieties of heirloom tomatoes; seven varieties of squash; two varieties of cucumber; two varieties of beets; cilantro; two varieties of onions; rainbow chard; celery; four varieties of chili peppers; fennel; purple cauliflower; broccoli; romaine; strawberries; raspberries; golden berries; green peppers; corn; onions; basil; carrots, and green beans.\n\nCollazo and Reyes have raised three sons; one is studying chemical engineering at UC Santa Cruz and another is studying microbiology at UC Berkeley. They both help with sales at La Milpa. Their youngest son is in fourth grade.\n\nCollazo and Reyes have a deep respect for the land that they farm and take pleasure in the crops that they produce. Collazo said, “I love to work the land. I don’t like using gloves, because . . . it’s like taking a shower with an umbrella, you understand, putting an umbrella over yourself when you wash. When I want to work, I want to feel the earth. When I pull the weeds, I want to feel my fingers penetrating the soil, feel that I’m pulling them up, that I’m doing it myself. My hands and my mind are linked. I really love to look around, walk up and down observing, surveying it all and saying, ‘Wow.’ That’s what fulfills me. When I’m at the farmers’ market, when people are arriving, reaching for the produce, and then later passing by, I feel like my self-esteem really rises. . . . But when you arrive over there and they tell you, ‘These are the best strawberries I’ve ever tasted, I’m going to take them’ — that is, they flatter you, ah, it makes you feel a light in your soul, you know?” Reyes added, “Like yesterday, when they had that festival and all of these people came out to buy, a man said to me, ‘I’ve never touched the sky, but with these strawberries I just did.’ So, how do you think that made me feel?”",

    "Farmer Bios":"When Carlos Daniel De Jesús came to California with his wife, Griselda Crecencio, as farmworkers in 2005, his main priority was to support his children back home in Oaxaca; in fact, Carlos did not really give much thought to owning his own farm business until he heard about an organization called ALBA. Inspired by his years in the field, his community of peers, and this new opportunity, Carlos enrolled in ALBA’s Farmer Education classes, learning both about organic farming practices and farm business management. After graduating from ALBA, Carlos and his wife started Coyo Organico Farm in 2017, growing their operation from half an acre on ALBA’s property to leasing their own 11 acres in Soledad. \n\nThroughout their journey in owning a farm, Carlos and his wife have displayed tremendous resiliency as they’ve navigated language barriers, destructive storms, and limited capital access. In particular, Carlos has experienced a lack of accessibility of business and technical information available in his primary language, needing to translate English into Spanish, and then Spanish into his native language, Triqui. Thus, Carlos has been proactive in engaging community resources to strengthen his business, hiring a bookkeeper, and working with partner organizations such as the Resource Conservation District of Monterey County and California FarmLink.  \n\nAfter thirteen years of tireless work, Carlos and his wife finally felt established enough to bring over their three children from Oaxaca and reunite in the U.S. Now, the family tends to the fields together, working to grow the business that sustains them.",

    "Farmer Bios":"source: Queen of Vegetables Organic Farm – Fresh Approach Yadira is the owner of The Queen of Vegetables Organic Farm, which operates on two separate properties: one in Salinas and the other in Royal Oaks. Each spans five acres—an impressive leap from the initial half-acre she first acquired in 2020.\n\nThough she may be the queen, Yadira’s reign is far from dynastic: when we asked her about her farming origin story, she revealed that “the biggest surprise is that I am the first generation of farmers in my family!” Despite having received a law education in her home country of Mexico, opportunities were scarce. She began her agricultural career on a California grape farm in 2007, where she immediately fell in love with spending her time outdoors in the open fields, forging camaraderie with fellow day laborers. Eventually, she secured a position at a seed breeding company where her passion for horticulture first took root.\n\n“In this place I learned how to sow the seed, to make it grow. I learned about the pathology of tomato plants. To see it grow, produce and harvest. There is so much to learn from each plant! All plants are different.” Horticultural expertise in tow, Yadira was introduced to the Agriculture and Land-Based Training Association (ALBA) by a colleague. There, she learned about organic farming, which she calls “agriculture for the new generation.” With the support of equitable farming organizations, she cultivated a lasting dedication to environmentalism and community nourishment.\n\nWhile The Queen of Vegetables is thriving, certified organic agriculture still comes with its challenges. If there’s one thing Yadira wants you to know about farming, it’s that it is difficult: organic farming is particularly labor-intensive and can be vulnerable to the volatility of a changing climate, and she notes that the costs of organic pest control oils are much higher than conventional options!",

    "Farmer Bios":"Bertha Magaña spent years working as a farmworker after immigrating to the US from Mexico, before she decided to begin her own farm business. Her dream was to build a farm that could provide a livelihood for her family and where she could work alongside her husband, Heriberto, and their three children. Bertha’s experience as a farmworker further inspired her passion for sustainable agriculture, shaping her interest in practices -- water conservation, planting hedgerow varieties to attract pollinators and other beneficial insects -- that would be just as kind to the planet as her family.\nBertha joined Kitchen Table Advisors in 2016, as a recent graduate from the Farmer Education Program (PEPA) at the Agriculture & Land-Based Training Association (ALBA). Her goal upon joining the advising program was to achieve her family’s dream of owning farmland. KTA immediately joined California FarmLink and the USDA’s Farm Service Agency in supporting Bertha through a land purchase, ensuring she and Heriberto were well-poised to take on the risk. In 2017, Magaña Farm purchased the nine acres they currently farm.\n\n",

The idea of starting his own business came to him in a conversation with his car mechanic, who mentioned that an organization called ALBA helped farmers start their own farm businesses. Hoping to find more freedom, empowerment, and learning through independent business ownership, Carlos applied to ALBA and started Torres Organic Farm with his wife Leticia in 2016. \n\nCarlos looks back on the decision to start his own business as one of his proudest accomplishments. Initially, Carlos started farming on half an acre of land. Currently in 2024, Carlos produces his delicious organic vegetables across 10.

    "Farmer Bios":"Alberto Mendoza came to the United States from Oaxaca, Mexico as a teenager. He spent his young adult life working various jobs on farms, in a garlic packaging factory, and in construction. Eventually, Alberto learned about the Agriculture and Land-Based Training Association (ALBA) through a colleague. At first, he began as a farmworker at ALBA, primarily on the strawberry farms, but soon his colleagues encouraged him to strike out on his own. An idea started to take shape: if Alberto launched his own business, he would be able to pursue his life-long passion while maintaining the independence of being his own boss and making his own schedule. \n\nHe officially established Ayoquezco Organic Produce in 2019, and currently leases 4.5 acres near Salinas. His new life chapter has brought his story full circle — in Mexico, Alberto grew up helping his father and grandfather with their harvests. His father often planted corn, beans and nuts, and his grandfather grew chilies and tomatoes. Now, through Ayoquezco Organic Produce, Alberto grows tomatillos, chilies, green beans, cauliflower, cabbage, carrots, zucchini, strawberries, celery, beets, cilantro, kale, tomatoes, and more. He cares for his land by avoiding pesticides, and has adopted practices like crop rotation and utilizing drip tape to reduce water use. \n\nCurrently, Alberto sells his produce to local school districts and direct to customers at farmers markets. He enjoys connecting with customers face-to-face and seeing the joy they get from his produce. Some days, his three oldest daughters come with him, helping out at the stand. \n\nFor Alberto, Ayoquezco Organic Produce’s purpose is to bring healthier, chemical-free produce to the people in his community, especially low-income families and kids. This desire motivates him to continue pursuing his passion and legacy every day. ",

    "Farmer Bios":"\nWho retires and gets a crazy idea to start a lavender farm? My dad!\n\nThe year was 1999. He planted thousands of lavender plants on the hillsides of his property in Salinas, California and sent me down to the Monterey farmer’s market to peddle it.\nI was fresh out of college, full of anxiety and depressed about my ambiguous career path. Each week when I would come home from farmer’s market, I noticed that my clothes and my car had a distinctive smell—that floral yet woodsy aroma that calms the mind and soothes the soul—lavender! And even better, I noticed the anxiety and depression I had battled in college had merely dissipated.\n\nI wanted a way for all people to experience this calming scent on a daily basis at an affordable price. As a family, we developed the lavender dryer sachet: a porous bag filled with just lavender flowers. Toss one into the clothes dryer and it infuses laundry and linens with the relaxing aromas of lavender. Furthermore, people could take these sachets with them on the go and use them in their cars, luggage, and more as an all-natural scent booster and source of aromatherapy. I had friends using the sachets as a calming agent during child birth. Other friends told me they carried sachets with them on airplanes to help them relax. Moms were stuffing them into their kid’s backpacks to help relieve their children of anxiety during school. Yes! If our sachets were helping so many people, I needed to spread the lavender love.\n\nIn 2017 my father passed away, but I continue to improve Purple Pastures and develop new products that help others relieve stress. Each year, we donate our lavender sachets to local causes in an effort to reduce anxiety in the world. Emergency room nursing stations, homeless shelters, and high schools that have experienced trauma have all been gifted our lavender sachets.\n\nYou can shop stress-free knowing that our business is based on the core values of integrity, quality and harmony. Our products can be found in thousands of retail stores nation-wide. Wholesale buyers can find us on RangeMe.com or by following our 3 step purchasing process. Furthermore, we are proud to be a certified woman-owned company through WBENC.\n\nWe at Purple Pastures Lavender Farm hope you can find some calm amongst the chaos as well. Shop all of our lavender products online or find us in your local natural foods store, and sachet the day away!",

    "Farmer Bios":"Daphne dreamed of having an organic lavender farm for two decades.  She wanted it to be a healthy, sustainable, environmentally- friendly, peaceful place for the well-being of her neighbors, family, friends, local wildlife, and surrounding community. Her dream become a labor of love. In 2014, she started the farm.      \n\nThrough perseverance, persistence, and constant presence, Daphne strives to work with organic farming practices and do the lavender planting, weeding, and harvesting by hand.\n\nWith the helpful oversight of Monterey County Certified Organic, Daphne worked to obtain organic certification for Lion Springs Lavender Farm.  Daphne is also the designer, planner, and manager.  Daphne Nixon trademarked the names, designed the logos, dreamed of and created the Carmel Caramel recipe, and makes the lavender products by hand. She cooks delicious Carmel Caramels and hand wraps each piece.\n\nDaphne leads Lion Springs Lavender Farm through good times and bad. The farm does its own beekeeping now, too. As a result, she gives private tours to small groups of school children to learn about the environmental benefits of organic farming. Daphne is very thankful for the kindness of friends who have helped at the farm.\n\nDaphne’s first love is oil painting. She is self-taught and studied since childhood to become a realistic oil painter. Today, she’s a member of the International Guild of Realism and exhibits her paintings at the Carmel Valley Art Association Gallery in Carmel Valley Village.",

    "Farmer Bios":"Hello! We are the Eichorn family, Peter, Janie, Ben and Lizzy. Our homestead farm is nestled in the mountains of Big Sur, California where we have been growing delicious organic fruit, vegetables and raising honey bees since 1983.\n\nOur property is called “Country Flat” but it is not really flat at all. When Peter was first inquiring about the property in the early 1980's he asked the previous owner if there was enough flat space to grow a garden or build a house. The man chuckled, took a moment, and said, \"well, it's country flat.\" Peter was intrigued and had to go see for himself. The property was covered in poison oak but underneath the thicket, he dug his hands into deep, dark soil. The rest is history.",

She is currently in her 2nd year of farming at the Agriculture and Land-Based Training Association’s (ALBA’s) Organic Farm Incubator program. RCDMC’s Agroecology Team started working closely with Angeles in early 2022, providing technical assistance with on-farm nutrient management tools like soil nitrate quick testing and consulting on irrigation design and scheduling.\n\nIn late 2022, Angeles approached RCDMC staff with a proposal for an on-farm research project that she hoped to submit to the Western Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE) Program’s Farmer\/Rancher Grant Program. Angeles’ research idea was to conduct a feasibility study of solarization – a non-chemical method of managing soilborne pests – for small-scale farmers in California’s Central Coast region. Her proposal was successful (WSARE Project No. FW23-435), and RCDMC’s Ag Technical Specialist, Aysha Peterson, now serves as the Technical Advisor on the project.\n\nIn the coming months, Angeles will continue to carry out her research project and hopes to share results from her study at the annual Ecological Farming Association (EcoFarm) conference in Pacific Grove in January. She is also in the process of refining her marketing strategy, which remains a challenge for many small-scale farmers in our area.",

    "Farmer Bios":"Margarita Castro, My Organic Farm | Feed the Hunger Fundtro-my-organic-farm\/ Margarita Castro, an Otomi Indigenous woman from Hidalgo, Mexico, and a single mother of four daughters, embodies resilience and determination. Growing up on a farm, she learned the value of hard work at an early age, assisting her father in planting corn when she was just four years old. After working as a farm laborer in California’s Central Coast, Margarita pursued her dream of running her own farm.\n\nIn 2019, she began taking farming classes through the Agriculture Land-Based Training Association (ALBA), and by 2020, she launched her farm on half an acre. Today, Margarita cultivates organic vegetables and strawberries on three acres, selling her produce to Coke Farm, local farmers’ markets, and schools—a partnership she established through ALBA. She also grows flowers to support pollinators, reflecting her commitment to sustainability and ecological stewardship.\n\nMargarita is driven by her passion for sustainable farming and her dedication to her community. She often starts her workdays at 4 a.m., motivated by the joy of seeing children’s curiosity about her farm. Speaking at the Latino Farmers Conference in Salinas, she expressed gratitude for ALBA’s support in overcoming challenges such as drought and flooding.\n\nHer goal is to expand her operation after completing five years with ALBA, furthering her contribution to her community and local food systems. My Organic Farm is currently a member of CCOF (California Certified Organic Farmers).",

    "Farmer Bios":"Set along the westernmost boundaries of Paso Robles and surrounded by the wild Santa Lucia Mountain Range of California’s Central Coast, the Halter Ranch Estate is a 2,700-acre organic nature estate dedicated to land, art, and 100% organically farmed grapes. Envisioned by Swiss entrepreneur, philanthropist, and world-leading land conservationist Hansjörg Wyss, the estate is an homage to his mother, Alice Halter. It is a haven for the natural world to continue flourishing while it delivers exceptional, timeless wines.\nKevin Sass: One of Paso Robles’ most renowned and respected winemakers, Kevin Sass, has been the winemaker behind the Adelaida district’s most famous wines for over 25 years. His craft focuses on phenolic analysis of the grapes, with the singular goal of making age-worthy wines of character and quality.\nLegend has it that while an intern at JUSTIN, Kevin would visit the Halter Estate to harvest a few extra clusters of grapes for his garage and make his own Halter wine.\nToday, he leads all vineyard and winery operations, including the oversight of our organic vineyard partnerships in Temecula and Texas.

    "Farmer Bios":"While the Smith's were turning the Avila Valley Barn, and Gopher Glen Apple Farm into some of the Central Coast's most coveted destinations, they also created an amazing family. As their children (one daughter, and six sons) grew, one in-particular, Jake Smith, started fostering a love for farming, and soon became responsible for the wonderful produce and apples available at Gopher Glen. In time his love for farming was rewarded when he and his wife, Raven, took over both management and ownership of the Gopher Glen Apple Farm. Not to be one to take apples for granted, as merely being a crisp snack on a warm Central Coast afternoon, Jake and Raven decided to venture into the world of ciders. So in 2016, Jake and Raven partnered up with Jesse (Jake's brother, and owner of the Farmer's Guild Catering Co.) and his wife, Collette (a wine sommelier), to co-create the Gopher Glen Cider Co.\n",

This gorgeous location, called the Estrella River Basin, offers a unique microclimate with hot sunny days and cool nights that are perfect for growing apples, stone fruit, and more.\n\nOn the property, we are currently cultivating over 19 apple varieties, 30 peach and nectarines trees, and numerous plums, pluots, apricots, cherries and pears. It’s a veritable cornucopia! The scale of our production allows us to preserve more traditional farming practices and protect biodiversity while still harvesting a high-quality product.\n\nAt Fair Hills Farms, we are committed to being a supplier of locally and sustainably grown premium organic produce.",

    "Farmer Bios":"Rich Mathews: Summers spent on a family dairy farm and college years in the agricultural heartland of the Midwest led to a lifelong fascination with the plants, animals, and machines involved in food production. Moving to California instilled an appreciation for fresh, organic produce and sustainable management of resources. Years of experience in the highly precise field of semi-conductor design (development and operations) provided a firm belief in attention to detail and quality.\nLooking for a venture to combine his interests and skills in a new way, Rich jumped at the opportunity to participate in the rebirth of the artisan olive oil industry in California. Having grown and made award winning olive oil Rich will continue with the producing of the oil. He is also spending spare moments fixing a 1930’s ranch house and turning a 1940’s Dairy Barn into the MoonShadow Grove office and packaging site in Paso Robles, CA.\n\nDiane Mathews: Diane enjoys the open vistas, birds, animals, and plants that are abundantly present on the ranch. She spends her time at the ranch tackling the challenges of bringing a 1930’s ranch house back to life. She is actively involved in the many fruit trees on site in Paso Robles including Goji berries which may be added to our products in the future. She loves visitors and sharing the ranching experience with her children and grandchildren.\n\nLeah & Ray: Leah shares her knowledge of marketing and sales to support the business end of the olive oil process and enjoys spending time in the slow lane as a break from her career in medical technology.\nRay uses his mechanical engineering background by tackling the renovation and repurposing of the equipment and tools on the ranch and provides creative insights into all aspects of our business.\n\nThe grandchildren love the wide open areas to play and get dirty while tracking the various animals, both wild and domestic.\n\nLauren & Jason: One of the San Diego branches of the family; Lauren and Jason make up our top sales team. Lauren also designed and hand-painted custom tasting bowls for each of our four Estate Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oils. They have proven to be a great way to keep track of our different oils during private tastings and parties.\n\nAudrey & Dan: The other San Diego branch enjoys visiting the ranch and helping out in the background as often as possible. Audrey is our resident graphic artist. She designed our fabulous labels and website and takes care of all our graphic needs as they appear.\n\nPhil & Jenna: Phil and Jenna supply marketing support from Camarillo.  Jenna also experiments with new recipes using our while Phil also helps the farm with his Mechanical Engineering background.\n\nGrandchildren: Our grandchildren, now at 8 of mixes ages, love to visit the farm and help with the chickens and testing the swings in the trees and driving go karts and golf carts.  They have also helped with putting up trellising for our grapes, picking fruit, picking grapes, and keeping Rich and Diane in good humor.",

    "Farmer Bios":"The Lyon family is proud to continue a rich ranching history. For approximately 6 decades the ranch was operated as a dairy by Swiss Italians who, like many others in the area, immigrated here in the late 1800’s to find new opportunities on land that reminded them of their homeland. They hand-milked their cows in the ranch barns and separated the cream from milk in the small building adjoining the barns. The product was taken by wagon to creameries in Cayucos and Harmony where it was made into butter and cheese and loaded on to ships at the wharf in Cayucos. When regulations made small dairies obsolete on the central coast, a shift was made from milk cows to raising beef cattle on the ranch.\n\nThe Lyons have had success with raising high quality and healthy Hass avocados, Valencia oranges and beef cattle. In 1999 Cottontail Creek Ranch added another branch to their operation, a luxury ranch vacation rental. The ranch house has been a successful addition toward achieving viable sustainable agriculture. Your hosts Susan, Kristopher and Michael Lyon invite you to join them for a getaway that will demand an encore!\n\nRoger (Chopper) Lyon April 23, 1949 - October 15, 2010\nLet us say farewell to a great person. Chop was a good father, son, uncle, grandfather, husband, and friend to all of us and he will be dearly missed. He will always be remembered and will forever remain in our hearts. Chop leaves a huge legacy in land conservation from the Hearst Ranch Conservation of 80,000 acres to the Estero Bluffs 4 miles of the north Cayucos coastline. We thank you forever.\n",

    "Farmer Bios":"Our Original Seed\nIn the late 1990's, there was a passing of the torch at the nursery.  We were obedient apprentices under the tutelage of Terry and Carolyn Harrison, the founders of Sonoma Antique Apple Nursery.  We dug trenches, painted barns, built chicken coops, filled potholes, cut firewood, and learned a few tricks along the way about grafting fruit trees.  Fortunately, the job we enjoyed most was the one they have passed over to our care: organic fruit tree propagation.  The pedestrian tasks are easily mastered, but the real lessons were learned simply by watching the determination and dedication Terry and Carolyn applied to their work at home and the local community.  Not only have they provided the greater community with thousands of fruit trees for 20 years, they have been active citizens participating in the local and regional level working to preserve considerably more than heirloom apples.  Terry and Carolyn continue to farm flower seeds and their cherished orchard.  Working with Terry and Carolyn Harrison was a deeply rewarding experience that provided innumerable lessons in perseverance, humility, and laughter.",

    "Farmer Bios":"source: ARROYO GRANDE BERRY FARM Maria Iniquez never imagined she would change her career from cosmetologist to farmer. Her brother Jose was always the farmer of the family with a dream of transitioning his strawberry farm to organic. Maria fell into farming when Jose unexpectedly passed away in 2015. She wanted to bring her brothers dream to fruition and to honor his memory and be close to him.\n\nIn 2016 Maria took over Arroyo Grande Farm with no experience farming and no one to teach her. She started with 25 acres and a few years ago the owners sold some of the land, leaving her with 10 acres. The farm is located in Arroyo Grande, about 20 minutes south of San Luis Obispo. Situated on a mesa overlooking the ocean, the sand dunes are visible in the distance. The ocean provides a lot of the cool early morning breezes and the daytime temperature remains a constant 65-70 degrees year round. Never too hot or too cold, this unique microclimate “helps contribute to the flavor and growth of the plants,” said Maria. A quick drive 20 minutes away and the weather becomes much cooler or warmer.\n\n“The first year taking on the farm there was a lot of trial and error growing strawberries. I put in hoop houses when I took over the land to help protect the strawberries from birds as well as prevent the berries from becoming too cold in the evening,” said Maria. \n\nMaria started with strawberries and now grows raspberries, snap peas, green beans, zucchini and fava beans are the newest addition to the farm. She rotates the crops throughout the year so there is always something growing. Strawberries are rotated with green beans and raspberries are rotated with zucchini.  Having a diverse crop rotation improves soil health, increases nutrients for the crops and helps to reduces erosion.\n\nThe best way to keep away the pests is to “keep the plants clean of weeds. We have hoops and a tractor doesn’t fit between the plants. We use pickers that pull the weeds by hand between the plants and on the road. It is very expensive to do by hand, “said Maria.\n\nArroyo Grande strawberries and raspberries are available on the shoulders of the season. Maria learned early on it is hard to compete on price with larger berry growers during the summer months. Arroyo Grande strawberries can be enjoyed as early as December through April\/May and raspberries come on in late April\/early May and then again in August.\n\nWhen asked what she wanted her customers to know, Maria said that she “calls Arroyo Grande “my brother’s ranch”.  My brother was a people person and he would be so happy. The strawberries were his dream. He would invite me to stay and watch the beautiful sunsets and sunrises from the ranch.”\n\nArroyo Grande is now harvesting sweet raspberries.",

    "Farmer Bios":"Sun Valley Berries, LLC. was established in 1993 by Rogelio Q. Ponce Sr. after acquiring the skills and knowledge to grow strawberries by working for various berry companies in Watsonville and also working alongside his father, Francisco Ponce, who was a strawberry share grower in the mid 1950’s.\n\nAfter many years of successfully growing conventional strawberries, Rogelio Q. Ponce Sr. entrusted in his sons to help begin a new chapter for their family business. With the help of his two sons, Rogelio Ponce Jr. and Steven Ponce, Sun Valley Berries, LLC began to also grow Organic Strawberries, Organic Blackberries and Raspberries.\n\nHowever, due to limited land availability in the Pajaro Valley, in particular, certified organic land, the Ponce’s realized that to remain viable in farming they would need to rotate crops within their current land holdings and diversify outside of berries and thus Sun Valley Farms began.",

    "Farmer Bios":"Jim Churchill\n\nI never had much of a plan for my life, I made an art form out of working with what came my way. Despite not really knowing what I wanted I have sometimes been able to recognize opportunity when it showed up, and I do like to work.​\n\nAn orchard showed up, and over time I have come to understand what an astonishing privilege and opportunity it has been. I built my life out of trying to stay out of the way of the trees, protecting and tending them, and the trees have responded. I had this idea that if the fruit tastes good I would be able to sell it, and so far that has proven true.​\n\nLisa Brenneis\n\nI think of there being two kinds of bass players – front liners, like Sting, say, or Jaco Pastorius; and all the other ones who stand in the back with the drummer, keeping the rhythm going and putting a bottom under the sound that makes the whole thing come together. Lisa played bass in pop and punk aggregations in LA in the 70s and 80s, and she kind of plays bass for Churchill Orchard. She hardly ever wants to be out front, but she definitely keeps the rhythm going, provides the bottom that makes the whole operation come together, and writes half the songs. Apart from strategic vision and a ferocious producer’s work ethic (“what’s the deliverable? what’s the budget? what’s the deadline? OK then, here’s how it’s going to play out….”), her art and her sensibility have created our image and are key to why we’re still here.​\n\nMike Sullivan\n\nMike called me in December of 2013 and informed me that he was coming to work for me. I told him I was all staffed up and didn’t have room. He showed up anyway. For the first year or so we didn’t know what to make of him – he may not have known back then what to make of himself. I still treasure the piece of rebar that he turned into a ram’s horns the first time he drove the flail mower – watching him careen around that first time was seeing a man finding his Joy. Family lore has it that as a very young child, when his grandmother tried to take him to the toy store, he insisted on going to a nursery instead (that’s plant nursery, not day care.) He cannot be made to put tools away, and he tends to treat small parts, like for instance the nozzles of fuel containers, as not worth keeping track of, but for cajoling production out of the trees, and sheer fierceness of approach to getting the work done, there’s no one like him.",

Owned and operated by Bill Jessup, B&J Ranch has been in existence for over 51 years. Bill took over the property in 1976 from his father and converted it to organic. Bill was an active organizer of CCOF in the ’70s and ’80s and helped build organic standards and programs. He also partnered with Veritable Vegetable early on to market his fruit to customers; today, Bill sells exclusively to VV. B&J Ranch has been able to grow and sustain itself over the past few decades by providing consistent, delicious high-quality fruit and managing operations themselves.",

Since then we have made it our goal to provide premium quality Mandarin Oranges, picked ripe and fresh. We also became Organic Certified growers a few years ago. Mandarin Oranges originate from Asia and have quickly become a favorite in the USA. They are sweet, seedless and easy to peel, which makes them a hit with kids and adults alike.\n\nMandarins are available from mid-November to mid-January. Because mandarins are soft and loose skinned, their storage time is limited to 1-2 weeks max. Store in a cool, dry place, like a garage or utility room. Refrigerators tend to dry out produce.   ",
